# eth-wallet

<br>
This app generates and displays a valid Ethereum address that can bet used to store any digital asset on the Ethereum network. It will also display its associated private key.
<br>
The address and private key generated is different for each unique device the app runs on.
<br>
Lighting up the app multiple times on the same device must generate the same address and private key every time.
